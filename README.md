# Lego Set Kit

Enter a Lego set ID and view the pieces needed to build it. Good for locating pieces in your
bins and setting aside a kit before you grab the instructions.

## Deployment Notes

** This is mostly for my own usage as I redo the deployments **

The GHPAGES_TOKEN is a short lived token generated by going to:
 - Github > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Fine-grained tokens

Generate a new token if needed and give it access to the kingcoyote.github.io repo, with
permission to read and write code. Take the token and go to the lego_setkit repo, go to:

 - Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets

The old expired one should still be there - overwrite it and the deploy should work again.

The API token is stored in:

  - Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Environment secrets
